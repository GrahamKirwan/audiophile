## My process

### Built with

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - JS library
- Hooks, Context, Router
- [Sass modules] - For styles
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Figma for design
- Vercel for deployment


### What I learned

My goal with this project was to build something robust with NextJS, as my last few projects have been using React. I wanted my internal pages to have valid SEO value and I wanted to focus on keeping components and functions small and clean.


### Continued development

I could have spent more time finessing the mobile version of this project but spending a couple of hours on media queries was not the goal of this project and so some quick media queries were added to make the site function on mobile - I could come back to this.
I could have also spent more than on form validation but again, this was not the goal of this project and so some simple 'required' pseudo-class' were added.
